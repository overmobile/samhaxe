Title: Resource description files
==================================

   Every asset library assembled with SamHaXe is described by an XML file
   called the resource description file. In this file you can specify which
   external resources will be imported, how they'll be called and which frame
   they'll reside on. The resource descriptor file is a standard XML file with
   namespaces. If you are not faimilar with XML files or namespaces within
   XML files then you should check the following links for more information
   about these subject:

Section: General layout of resource description files
------------------------------------------------------
   Resource description files are plain XMLs with namespaces. Before
   descending into the details let's see a simple resource description file as
   an example:
   (code)
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   
   <shx:resources version="9" compress="false" package="my.package.resources"
      xmlns:shx="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe"
      xmlns:img="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Image"
      xmlns:font="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Font">

      <shx:frame>
         <img:image import="logo.png" class="Logo" />
      
         <font:ttf import="simple.ttf" name="MinimalFont">
            <font:characters>
               <font:include range="a..z"/>
               <font:include range="A..Z"/>
               <font:include range="0..9"/>
               <font:include characters=" ,.:!?-()"/>
            </font:characters>
         </font:ttf>
      </shx:frame>

      <shx:frame>
         <img:image import="background.jpg" class="BackgroundImage" />
         <font:ttf import="fancy.ttf" name="MainFont" />
      </shx:frame>

   </shx:resources>
   (end)

   Huhh... "You call that simple?!" some would ask. Well it may look a bit
   complicated at first sight but it's fairly straightforward if you take a
   closer look. In the following sections we'll examine each element in
   detail.

-----------------------
Group: XML declaration
-----------------------
   Standard XML declaration.

   > <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   There's nothing much to talk about here. It's a standard XML declaration:
   
   version - The version of used XML standard
   encoding - Character encoding of the resource description file

---------------------------------
Group: <shx:resources>
---------------------------------
   The root XML node defines general attributes and namespaces used through importing.
   
   >  <shx:resources version="9" compress="false" package="resources"
   >     xmlns:shx="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe"
   >     xmlns:img="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Image"
   >     xmlns:font="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Font">

   Every resource description file has a root node called _shx:resources_.
   Every XML node associated with SamHaXe (and not with some of its modules)
   uses the namespace _shx_. Let's see its available attrubtes first:

   version - Version of the generated SWF file as a numeric value between 1 and
      10 (as of this writing). It has effect on SWF tag generation of import modules
      because some tags are only supported in specific flash versions.

   compress - (false, true) Controls the compression of the generated SWF
      file.

   package - Optional attribute specifying the package of generated symbol
      classes and AS3 class stubs. It's a convenience attribute so you don't
      have to write _my.package.resources_ before every class name.

   The following optional attributes are interesting only in the case of
   non-resource library SWF files, so you can safely disregard them most of the
   time.

   network - Optional attribute specifying the default sandbox of the SWF.
      If _"true"_ then network-only sandbox, else local-with-filesystem sandbox
      (the default).

   w - Optional attribute, integer number, the width of the SWF.

   h - Optional attribute, integer number, the height of the SWF.

   fps - Optional attribute, integer number, the FPS of the SWF.

   Besides the attributes there are two namespace decralations (except shx)
   in the root node: _img_ and _font_. You assign an import module to a
   namespace with a namespace declaration. After that if SamHaXe encounters
   an XML node with namespace other than _shx_ it'll invoke the appropriate
   import module for that node. The namespace URI reference and actual import
   module assignments are in SamHaXe's configuration file called _samhaxe.conf.xml_.
   See <Configuration> for more information.

   An import module may support more than one module interface version. If
   you need a specific version of a module you can specify it in the URI as an
   anchor. For example:

   >  <shx:resources version="9" compress="false" package="resources"
   >     xmlns:shx="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe"
   >     xmlns:img="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Image"
   >     xmlns:font="http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Font#1.1">

   Here you query version 1.1 of Font import module. See <Version numbers> for
   more information.

   Least but not last here is a list of standard import modules and their
   namespace URI:

   Compose - http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Compose
   Binary - http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Binary
   Font - http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Font
   Image - http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Image
   Sound - http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Sound
   Swf - http://mindless-labs.com/samhaxe/modules/Swf

------------------
Group: <shx:frame>
------------------
   Defines a new frame in the generated SWF file.

   Why do we need frames anyway? We only want to import images, sounds, fonts
   and other things and that's it. Well, it's almost true. But there's an
   interesting feature called _preloading_ which requires frames.
   
   Suppose you have a web site with a flash animation embedded in it. When
   someone opens your site in a web browser the browser detects that
   there's a flash animation and passes the URL of the animation to flash
   player. The flash player then starts downloading it but as soon as the
   first frame is loaded it starts playing the animation and executing AS3
   code. It won't wait until every frame has loaded. It has advantages and
   disadvantages. If it's a "traditional" flash animation then the animation
   can be jumpy on a slow internet connection becuase the download speed might
   be lower that required for a smooth animation. On the other hand if you put
   only a few assets on the first frame you can display a message such as
   "Please wait..." and wait till the other assetes are loaded. It's much
   friendlier solution than to put everything on the first frame and have the
   user to watch an empty window while flash player is loading.

   Now back to resource definitions. In SamHaXe every asset resides on a
   frame. It's not a big surprise cosidering the design of SWF. A frame can
   contain any number of assets (even zero). You can define a new frame with
   the
   
   > <shx:frame>
   >   ...
   > </shx:frame>

   XML tag pairs. Frames are automatically numbered starting from 1 so assets
   imported between the first frame tags will reside on the first frame
   (important for preloading).

--------------
Group: Assets
--------------
   Imported resources of different kind.

   Within frames you can import different kind of resources (assets) by
   specifying XML tags defined by import modules. You reference an import
   module with it's assigned namespace. Let's see an example from the above
   resource description file:

   > <img:image import="logo.png" class="Logo" />

   Okay, what does it tell us? The namespace is _img_ which is assigned to the
   <Image.hx> import module. This module defines the <image> XML tag which can be
   used to import a wide range of image file formats. The attributes are:

   import - The name of file to import.
   class - The class name we can refer to the imported asset in AS3. Because
   we specified the _package_ attribute in _<shx:resources>_ earlier the
   resulting class name will be: _my.package.resources.Logo_

   There's one more asset import on the first frame
   (code)
   <font:ttf import="simple.ttf" name="MinimalFont">
      <font:characters>
         <font:include range="a..z"/>
         <font:include range="A..Z"/>
         <font:include range="0..9"/>
         <font:include characters=" ,.:!?-()"/>
      </font:characters>
   </font:ttf>
   (end)

   It imports the specified character images (glyphs) from _simple.ttf_ with
   the name: _MinimalFont_. We won't go into details of <ttf> XML tag. You can
   read the full documentation at <Font.hx>.

   After flash player loads these two assets it starts executing AS3 code
   (it always resides on the first frame). You can display the logo, and
   some simple message while the player is loading the remaining frames.
