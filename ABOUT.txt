Title: About SamHaXe
=====================

Section: "I used to be a spy, until..."
----------------------------------------
   Why exactly SamHaXe? Where does that name come from? If you're
   familiar with _Burn Notice_ the name _Sam Axe_ might ring a bell.
   Burn Notice is a series about spies - and what do flash developers  
   and spies have in common? They need assets. Assets are very important.

   What does Sam HaXe good for? 

   Basically Sam HaXe is a flash resource assembly tool similar to swfmill
   (http://swfmill.org). Currently you can import the following types of assets
   with it:

   - *Image files*: Every type supported by ImageMagick or DevIL See the complete
     list here: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php,
     http://openil.sourceforge.net/features.php

   - *Sound files*: MP3s, WAVs
   
   - *TrueType fonts*

   - *SWF files*: As an animation or as an external library.
   - *Binary files*: Arbitrary content with optional zlib compression.

Section: Features
------------------
   What does SamHaXe offer?

Platform independence:
   SamHaXe is written in _haXe_ and runs on _neko VM_ so you can compile and
   use it on serveral platforms. The build system uses the java based
   _Apache Ant_ which primary objective is to be cross-platform. Finally,
   SamHaXe is a command line tool so there's no need for a GUI which is
   the source of many incompatibilities across different platforms.

Modular import system:
   The core of SamHaXe is very minimal. Most of the work is carried out by
   various import modules which are freely replacable.  That way you're not
   bound to the standard import modules you can use any third party ones
   or even write your own.

Detailed documentation:
   We're cosidering documentation as important as the feaures or even more
   What good is a tool if you don't know how to use it, right? So we tried
   the documentation to be as detailed as possible. No more second guessing
   about a particular command line switch or XML tag. Everyting is documented.

Open Source with the very permissive MIT license:
   Our goal with SamHaXe is to provide an easy to use tool which is accessible
   for users and developers. We don't want to restrict you by any means so we
   decided to go with the MIT license which is permissive enough to fit our
   and - more importantly - _Your_ needs.

Section: Used softwares and tools
---------------------------------
   What is it based on?

   The following softwares and tools are used creating SamHaXe:

   HaXe language and compiler - (http://haxe.org) SamHaXe is written in haXe

   hxformat haXe library - (http://code.google.com/p/hxformat) hxformat is a
      library capable of reading/writing several file formats. We're using it
      for reading/writing SWF files.

   Neko virtual machine  - (http://nekovm.org) SamHaXe and its
      modules are running under neko VM.

   ImageMagick - (http://www.imagemagick.org) The native part of Image import
      module uses ImageMagick to load images of different formats.

   DevIL - (http://openil.sourceforge.net/) An alternative to ImageMagick.

   FreeType 2 - (http://www.freetype.org/index2.html) The native part of Font
      import module uses FreeType to load TrueType fonts.

   Apache Ant - (http://ant.apache.org) The build system is based on Apache
      Ant.

   anthx - (http://code.google.com/p/anthx) anthx is a collection of Ant tasks
      supporting haXe/neko. SamHaXe is bundled with a copy of anthx with some
      minor modifications.

   cpptasks - (http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/cpptasks/index.html)
      cpptasks is a collection of Ant tasks supporting several C/C++ compilers.
      Used for compiling native modules. SamHaXe is bundled with a copy of
      cpptasks with some minor modifications.

   NaturalDocs - (http://www.naturaldocs.org) Documentation is generated
      entirely with NaturalDocs.
