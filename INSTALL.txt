Group: Prerequisities
---------------------------------
Dependencies required by SamHaXe. *Please note that the following applies only
to _win32 binary versions_. You _don't_ have to configure anything when using the
_win32 installer_.*

To use the precompiled Win32 binary you will need the following software
installed on your system:

   FreeType 2 - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/>
   ImageMagick - <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows>
   ... or ... - (depending on your choice of binary)
   DevIL - <http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php>

---------------------------------
Group: FreeType settings
---------------------------------
   Steps required using FreeType for font import.

   Let's assume that FreeType is installed under _C:\Program Files\FreeType2_. Then
   the following path has to be added to PATH environment variable:

      C:\Program Files\FreeType2\bin - Required for locating *freetype6.dll*.

---------------------------------
Group: ImageMagick settings
---------------------------------
   Steps required when using ImageMagick for image import.

   Let's assume that ImageMagick is installed under _C:\Program Files\ImageMagick_.
   Then the two additional paths have to be added to PATH environment
   variable:

      C:\Program Files\ImageMagick - Required for locating *CORE_RL_XXXX_.dll*
      files.
      C:\Program Files\ImageMagick\modules - Required for sub-modules used by
      ImageMagick.

   Furthermore it looks like that windows binary releases of ImageMagick link
   to Visual C's runtime libraries so you have to install those too. From
   ImageMagick's website:

   > If you have any problems, install the
   > Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) or
   > Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64).
   > 64-bit Windows requires both packages (x86 & x64).

   Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) -
      http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2

---------------------------------
Group: DevIL settings
---------------------------------
   Steps required when using DevIL for image import.

   Let's assume that DevIL is installed under _C:\Program Files\DevIL_. Then
   the following path has to be added to PATH environment variable:

      C:\Program Files\DevIL\lib - Required for locating *DevIL.dll* and
      *ILU.dll* files.

Section: Compiling from source

---------------------------------
Group: Prerequisities
---------------------------------
Dependencies required by SamHaXe.

To compile SamHaXe you will need several software packages installed on your
system.

Required software:

   HaXe compiler - <http://haxe.org/download> 
   Neko virtual with C dev package - <http://nekovm.org/download>
   Some supported C/C++ sompiler suite - GCC, MinGW or VisualStudio
   ImageMagick with C/C++ dev package - <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php>
   DevIL with C/C++ dev package - <http://openil.sourceforge.net/download.php>
   FreeType 2 with C/C++ dev package - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/>
   Apache Ant 1.7 or better - <http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi>
   NaturalDocs - <http://www.naturaldocs.org/download.html>

----------------------------------
Group: Build configuration
----------------------------------
Configuring build options, dependencies and installation paths.

After installing the required software packages you should take a look at
_config.ant.sample_ file and create _config.ant_ with the appropriate options
for your system.

Available options:

   haxe.path - (Default: HAXEPATH environment variable) Path to haXe
   executable. It's important to set either this variable correctly or define
   HAXEPATH otherwise ant won't find haXe compiler.

   haxe.stdpath - (Default: haxe.path/std) Path to haXe standard library.

   haxe.debug - (true / _false_) Enable/disable debugging. 

   cpp.compiler - (_g++_ / msvc) C++ compiler to use for compiling native
   modules. The C++ compiler has to be accessible from the command line so you
   should add it to PATH.

   image.module - (_imagemagick_ / devil) Specifies the native image loading
   module to use. The default is ImageMagick right now but DevIL is the
   preferred one because it's much more easier to install and can create
   images without alpha channel which reduces the size of resulting asset
   library.

   imagemagick.include.path - Path to ImageMagick's header files. Required
   for compiling native image-imagemagick  module. You can obtain this value
   under linux by issuing the command: "pkg-config --cflags-only-I Wand" This
   is the directory where *Magick++.h* is located.

   imagemagick.library.path - Path to ImageMagick's shared library files. This is the
   directory where *CORE_RL_wand_.dll* (MinGW), *CORE_RL_wand_.lib* (MSVC) or
   *libMagickWand.so* / *libWand.so* / *MagickWand.dylib* (gcc) is located.
   
   imagemagick.library.name - Name of ImageMagick's shared library without any
   prefix or suffix. Typical values are: *CORE_RL_wand_* (MinGW and MSVC),
   *MagickWand* or *Wand* (gcc)

   devil.include.path - Path to DevIL's header files. This is the directory
   where the *IL/* directory opens from.

   devil.library.path - Path to DevIL's library files. This is the directory
   where *DevIL.dll*, *ILU.dll*  (MinGW and MSVC) / *libIL.so*, *libILU.so*
   (gcc) are located.

   devil.base.library.name - Name of DevIL's base shared library without any
   prefix or suffix. Typical values are: *DevIL* (MinGW and MSVC) or *IL* (gcc).
   
   devil.util.library.name - Name of DevIL's util shared library without any
   prefix or suffix. The typical value is: *ILU*.

   neko.include.path - Path to neko's include files. Required for all native
   modules (image and font). This is the directory where *neko.h* is located.

   neko.library.path - Path to neko's library files. This is the directory
   where *neko.dll* (MinGW), *neko.lib* (MSVC) or *libneko.so* / *neko.dylib*
   (gcc) is located.

   freetype.include.path - Path to FreeType's include directory. This is the
   directory where *ft2build.h* is located.

   freetype.library.path - Path to FreeType's shared library files. This is
   the directory where *freetype6.dll* (MinGW), *freetype.lib* (MSVC) or
   *libfreetype.so* / *freetype.dylib* (gcc) is located.

   freetype.library.name - Name of FreeType's shared library without any
   prefix or suffix. Typical values are: *freetype6* (MinGW) or *freetype*
   (MSVC or GCC).

   naturaldocs.path - (_current working directory_) Path to NaturalDocs' installation
   directory. NaturalDocs will be executed in this directory.

   naturaldocs.executable - (_NaturalDocs_) Full path to NaturalDocs'
   executable. Under windows you should use some\path\NaturalDocs.bat here.

   install.path - (_/usr/local_) Base installation path.

   install.path.bin - (_install.path/bin_) Binaries installation path.

   install.path.modules - (_install.path/lib/samhaxe_) Modules installation
   path.

   install.path.doc - (_install.path/doc/samhaxe_) Documentation installation
   path.

   install.path.config - (_/etc_) Configuration installation path.

Configuring the C++ compiler under windows:

   SamHaXe uses native modules (neko primitives in neko terms) to achieve
   tasks which require using external libraries not currently supported by
   neko. These modules are written in C++ so ant has to be able to invoke the
   appropriate C++ compiler. There are no options concerning the path to the
   compiler so make sure it's accessible from the command line without
   problems. For example MSVC provides a batch file called "Microsoft Visual
   Studio Command Prompt" which is accessible from the start menu. Launching
   this command prompt appends MSVC to PATH environment variable.

Configuring FreeType under windows:

   FreeType requires some more configuration beyond specifying include and
   library paths. That is because the compiled native modules have to be able
   to locate FreeType's DLL. This can be achieved with one more path
   added to the PATH environment variable. Let's assume that FreeType is
   installed under _C:\Program Files\FreeType2_. Then the additional path is:

      C:\Program Files\FreeType2\bin - Required for locating *freetype6.dll*.

Configuring ImageMagick under windows:

   ImageMagick requires some more configuration beyond specifying include and
   library paths. That is because the compiled native modules have to be able
   to locate ImageMagick's DLLs. This can be achieved with two more paths
   added to the PATH environment variable. Let's assume that ImageMagick is
   installed under _C:\Program Files\ImageMagick_. Then the two additional
   paths are:

      C:\Program Files\ImageMagick - Required for locating *CORE_RL_XXXX_.dll*
      files.
      C:\Program Files\ImageMagick\modules - Required for sub-modules used by
      ImageMagick.

   Furthermore it looks like that windows binary releases of ImageMagick link
   to Visual C's runtime libraries so you have to install those too. From
   ImageMagick's website:

   > If you have any problems, install the
   > Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) or
   > Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64).
   > 64-bit Windows requires both packages (x86 & x64).

   Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86) -
      http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2

   Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64) -
      http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BA9257CA-337F-4B40-8C14-157CFDFFEE4E

Configuring DevIL under windows:

   DevIL requires some more configuration beyond specifying include and
   library paths. That is because the compiled native modules have to be able
   to locate DevIL's DLLs. This can be achieved with one more path
   added to the PATH environment variable. Let's assume that DevIL is
   installed under _C:\Program Files\DevIL_. Then the additional path is:

      C:\Program Files\DevIL\lib - Required for locating *DevIL.dll* and
      *ILU.dll* files.

Group: Building SamHaXe
----------------------------------
Compiling the source, building the documentation.

Every component of SamHaXe can be built with the corresponding ant target. You
can build an ant target from the command line issuing the command from the
project's base directory:
> prompt> ant target_name

Available targets are:

   clean - Clean up previously built binaries, documentation, temporary
      files, etc.

   demos - Build several assets and sample SWF applications. Assembled assets
      go to _demos/bin/assets_, compiled applications go to _demos/bin/apps_.

   dist - Build a zip compressed binary distribution.

   doc - Build documentation with NaturalDocs.

   install - Install SamHaXe and documentation into the specified directories.

   modules - Compile SamHaXe modules

   native - Compile native modules.

   samhaxe - Compile the entire source including modules, native modules and
      SamHaXe itself. This is the default target.
   
   win32-installer - Build a NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System,
      http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) based win32 installer. Only available under
      windows and with DevIL image library.

To compile SamHaxe issue the following command:
> prompt> ant

This will compile native modules, modules, SamHaXe and place the binaries
under the _bin_ directory.

To install binaries and documentation:
> prompt> ant install
